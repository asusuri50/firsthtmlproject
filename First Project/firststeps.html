    <h2>Formula One - Top 5 Drivers</h2>
    <h3>1. Michael Schumacher - 7 Time World Champion</h3>
    <p>When considering the best F1 driver, <strong>Michael Schumacher</strong> immediately springs to mind.the face of domination in 
        <strong>Formula 1</strong>: seven titles (five of them consecutive), a seemingly insurmountable number of wins, unrelenting 
        competitiveness – Schumacher changed the game in <strong>F1</strong> with his combination of dedication, passion, and, of course, 
        raw talent.

            <br>
            - <em>Michael Schumacher</em>
        </blockquote>
    </p>

    <h3>2. Lewis Hamilton - 7 Time World Champion</h3>
    <p>In terms of career wins and total career points, <strong>Lewis Hamilton</strong> is the best <strong>Formula 1</strong> 
        driver to have ever graced a circuit. The Brit has taken wins in 30 different countries, won a race in almost 
        every season he’s competed in, and is currently tied on world championships with <bold>Michael Schumacher.</bold>
        <br>
        <blockquote>"The way I drive, the way I handle a car, is an expression of my inner feelings."
            <br>
            - <em>Lewis Hamilton</em>
        </blockquote>
    </p>
    
    <h3>3. Ayrton Senna - 3 Time World Champion</h3>
    <p>One of motorsport's most legendary figures, Ayrton Senna 
        remains the benchmark for raw talent and charisma. His depth of commitment to a lap and his constant desire 
        to push the boundaries for more has meant that Senna has a special place in the hearts of many motorsport fans.

            - <em>Ayrton Senna</em>
        </blockquote>
    </p>

    <h3>4. Sebastian Vettel - 4 Time World Champion</h3>
    <p>Vettel’s <strong>F1</strong> career started in 2007 and, in his first three years, he took nine podiums and 
        five wins, though this was nothing on what was to come. Over the next four years he became the face of 
        <strong>F1</strong>, winning four consecutive championships and becoming the youngest <strong>F1 world 
        champion</strong> in the process (taking the accolade from <strong>Lewis Hamilton</strong>).

            are not the things that make you happy. It is the small things that make life good."
            <br>
        - <em>Sebastian Vettel</em>
    </blockquote>
</p>

    <h3>5. Alain Prost - 4 Time World Champion</h3>
    <p>It was <strong>Alain Prost's</strong> meticulous style that allowed him to go up against <strong>Ayrton 
        Senna</strong> – the bitter feud that he is best remembered for. His secret weapon was brainpower, as well 
        as speed, and he possessed a natural precision in his driving that allowed <strong>Prost</strong> to 
        become <i>France's first world champion in 1985</i>.

            and going fast."

            - <em>Alain Prost</em>
